# RescueTime Productivity Predictor

Use your RescueTime data to forecast your productivity.

## Project Setup

1. Create a .env file and paste .env.example into it with the data that pertains to you (i.e. Your RescueTime API Key).
2. In `generate_data.ipynb`, change the years variable to match the years that you want the generator to search RescueTime for.
